- âœ… Distributed systems theory (5/15 completed)
- âœ… System architecture (3/18 completed)  
- âœ… Security & authentication (4/8 completed)

### Phase 2: Complete All Groups (Next Steps)
1. Create remaining database subtopics (6 remaining)
2. Complete distributed systems theory (10 remaining)
3. Finish system architecture concepts (15 remaining)
4. Complete security subtopics (4 remaining)
5. Add all network & communication subtopics (16 remaining)
6. Create data storage & retrieval subtopics (12 remaining)
7. Add cloud & infrastructure concepts (10 remaining)
8. Complete development & operations (12 remaining)
9. Add performance & monitoring (8 remaining)
10. Create specialized concepts (4 remaining)

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. Update sampleData.js with all 115 subtopics
2. Test navigation and search functionality
3. Verify mobile responsiveness
4. Optimize loading performance
5. Add cross-references between related topics

## File Naming Convention

Each subtopic file follows the pattern:
- File name: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `consistentHashing.js`)
- Export name: `camelCase` (e.g., `consistentHashing`)
- ID: `kebab-case` (e.g., `consistent-hashing`)
- Title: `Proper Case` (e.g., `Consistent Hashing`)

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Related concepts are grouped together for better learning
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update related concepts
3. **Navigation**: Users can explore related topics more easily
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new subtopics to appropriate groups
5. **Search**: Better search results due to logical organization
6. **Performance**: Modular loading of related content

## Next Steps

1. Create the remaining 69 subtopic files systematically
2. Update imports in sampleData.js for all new files
3. Test the complete implementation
4. Deploy and verify functionality
5. Gather user feedback for further improvements

This organization ensures that all 115 subtopics from TechNotes are logically arranged and easily maintainable while providing an excellent user experience for interview preparation.
