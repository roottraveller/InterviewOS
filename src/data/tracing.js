## Definition
Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through multiple services in a distributed system, providing end-to-end visibility.

## Key Concepts
- **Trace**: Complete journey of a request through the system
- **Span**: Individual operation within a trace
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire request
- **Span ID**: Unique identifier for each operation
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Service call hierarchy

## Span Attributes
- **Operation Name**: What the span represents
- **Start Time**: When operation began
- **Duration**: How long operation took
- **Tags**: Key-value metadata
- **Logs**: Time-stamped events within span
- **Status**: Success, error, or timeout

## Trace Propagation
- **Context Propagation**: Pass trace context between services
- **HTTP Headers**: Carry trace IDs in requests
- **Message Queues**: Propagate context through async messaging
- **Database Calls**: Track database operations

## Sampling Strategies
- **Head-based Sampling**: Decision at trace start
- **Tail-based Sampling**: Decision after trace completion
- **Probabilistic**: Random percentage sampling
- **Rate-based**: Fixed number of traces per second
- **Adaptive**: Dynamic sampling based on conditions

## Popular Tracing Systems
- **Jaeger**: Open-source distributed tracing
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing system
- **AWS X-Ray**: Amazon's tracing service
- **Google Cloud Trace**: Google's tracing solution
- **Azure Application Insights**: Microsoft's APM

## OpenTelemetry
- **Unified Standard**: Vendor-neutral observability framework
- **Auto-instrumentation**: Automatic trace generation
- **Manual Instrumentation**: Custom span creation
- **Multiple Backends**: Support for various tracing systems

## Benefits
- **Performance Debugging**: Identify bottlenecks
- **Error Root Cause**: Trace error propagation
- **Service Dependencies**: Understand service interactions
- **Latency Analysis**: Measure request processing time
- **Capacity Planning**: Identify resource constraints

## Implementation Challenges
- **Performance Overhead**: Tracing impact on application
- **Sampling Decisions**: Balance detail vs performance
- **Context Propagation**: Ensure complete trace coverage
- **Storage Costs**: Managing trace data volume
- **Complexity**: Distributed system instrumentation

## Best Practices
- **Meaningful Span Names**: Clear operation descriptions
- **Appropriate Sampling**: Balance cost vs visibility
- **Error Handling**: Capture and propagate errors
- **Custom Attributes**: Add business context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track tracing overhead

## Interview Questions
**Q: How does distributed tracing help with microservices debugging?**
A: It provides end-to-end visibility of request flow across services, helping identify bottlenecks, errors, and dependencies in complex distributed systems.`
