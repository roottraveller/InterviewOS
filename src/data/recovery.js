    <p>Database recovery is the process of restoring a database to a correct state after a failure or corruption. It encompasses techniques, procedures, and strategies to ensure data integrity and system availability in the face of various types of failures, from simple transaction errors to catastrophic disasters.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Real-World Example: Amazon's Multi-Region Recovery Strategy</strong></summary>
      <div class="info-note">
        Amazon's DynamoDB serves 20+ million requests per second across multiple regions worldwide. Their recovery strategy includes real-time cross-region replication, automated failover within 30 seconds, and point-in-time recovery up to 35 days. During the 2017 S3 outage that affected the US-East-1 region, DynamoDB's recovery systems automatically failed over to other regions, maintaining 99.999% availability. The system uses continuous data protection with 11 9's of durability (99.999999999%), automated backup every second, and can recover from any point in time within the retention period. This comprehensive recovery strategy protects against hardware failures, software bugs, human errors, and regional disasters.

    <h3>Recovery Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>Understanding recovery fundamentals is crucial for designing resilient database systems that can maintain data integrity and availability under various failure scenarios.</p>

    <h4>Types of Database Failures</h4>
    <p>Database systems face various types of failures, each requiring different recovery approaches:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Failure Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>

    <h4>Recovery Objectives</h4>
    <p>Recovery strategies are designed around two critical metrics that define business requirements:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>Recovery Objectives:

RTO (Recovery Time Objective):
├── Definition: Maximum acceptable downtime
├── Measurement: Time to restore service
├── Business Impact: Revenue loss, customer impact
└── Examples:
    ├── Tier 1 Systems: RTO < 1 hour
    ├── Tier 2 Systems: RTO < 4 hours
    └── Tier 3 Systems: RTO < 24 hours

RPO (Recovery Point Objective):
├── Definition: Maximum acceptable data loss
├── Measurement: Time between last backup and failure
├── Business Impact: Data loss, compliance issues
└── Examples:
    ├── Financial Systems: RPO < 1 minute
    ├── E-commerce: RPO < 15 minutes
    └── Analytics: RPO < 4 hours

Relationship:
- Lower RTO/RPO = Higher cost and complexity
- Higher RTO/RPO = Lower cost but higher risk
- Balance based on business criticality</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h4>Recovery Strategy Components</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Backup Strategy:</strong> Regular data backups with appropriate frequency</li>
      <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Real-time or near-real-time data copying</li>
      <li><strong>Failover Mechanisms:</strong> Automatic switching to backup systems</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Continuous health checks and alerting</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Regular recovery procedure validation</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Clear recovery procedures and contacts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Transaction Recovery</h3>
    <p>Transaction recovery ensures database consistency by handling individual transaction failures and maintaining ACID properties.</p>

    <h4>Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)</h4>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> All changes are first written to a log before being applied to the database, ensuring recoverability.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>Write-Ahead Logging Process:

1. Transaction Begins:
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   
2. Log Entry Written First:
   LOG: [TXN-001] BEGIN
   LOG: [TXN-001] UPDATE users SET balance = 1000 WHERE id = 123
   
3. Data Modified in Memory:
   Buffer Pool: users[123].balance = 1000
   
4. Log Forced to Disk:
   WAL Buffer → Disk (fsync)
   
5. Data Eventually Written:
   Buffer Pool → Data Files (checkpoint)
   
6. Transaction Commits:
   LOG: [TXN-001] COMMIT
   
7. Commit Log Forced to Disk:
   Commit Record → Disk (fsync)

WAL Rules:
1. Log record must be written before data page
2. All log records must be written before commit
3. Transaction not committed until commit record on disk
4. Undo information logged before changes
5. Redo information logged after changes

Benefits:
✓ Durability guarantee
✓ Crash recovery possible
✓ Rollback capability
✓ Performance optimization (sequential writes)</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h4>ARIES Recovery Algorithm</h4>
    <p><strong>ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics):</strong> Industry-standard recovery algorithm used by most modern databases.</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>ARIES Three-Phase Recovery:

Phase 1: Analysis
├── Scan log from last checkpoint
├── Identify active transactions at crash
├── Determine dirty pages in buffer pool
└── Build transaction table and dirty page table

Phase 2: Redo
├── Replay all logged actions from appropriate point
├── Restore database to state at crash time
├── Apply both committed and uncommitted changes
└── Ensure durability of committed transactions

Phase 3: Undo
├── Rollback uncommitted transactions
├── Use undo records to reverse changes
├── Process transactions in reverse order
└── Ensure atomicity of incomplete transactions

Example Recovery Scenario:
Crash occurs at LSN 150

Analysis Phase:
- Last checkpoint at LSN 100
- Active transactions: T1, T2, T3
- Dirty pages: P1, P2, P3, P4

Redo Phase:
- Start from LSN 100
- Replay all changes through LSN 150
- Database state at crash time restored

Undo Phase:
- T1: Committed (no undo needed)
- T2: Rollback changes (LSN 140 → 120)
- T3: Rollback changes (LSN 145 → 110)

Final State:
- All committed transactions preserved
- All uncommitted transactions rolled back
- Database consistent and durable</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h4>Checkpoint Mechanisms</h4>
    <p><strong>Checkpointing:</strong> Periodic process to reduce recovery time by creating consistent database states.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Checkpoint Type</th>
          <th>Process</th>
          <th>Impact</th>
          <th>Use Case</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Consistent Checkpoint</td>
          <td>Stop all transactions, flush buffers</td>
          <td>System unavailable</td>
          <td>Batch systems</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fuzzy Checkpoint</td>
          <td>Flush buffers without stopping transactions</td>
          <td>Minimal impact</td>
          <td>OLTP systems</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Incremental Checkpoint</td>
          <td>Flush only dirty pages since last checkpoint</td>
          <td>Very low impact</td>
          <td>High-throughput systems</td>
        </tr>

      <summary><strong>Example: Google's Spanner Global Recovery</strong></summary>
      <div class="info-note">
        Google's Spanner database serves as the backbone for Gmail, Google Ads, and Google Cloud, processing millions of transactions per second across 100+ data centers worldwide. Their recovery system uses synchronized global timestamps, multi-version concurrency control, and automatic failover across continents. During regional outages, Spanner automatically redistributes traffic to healthy regions within 10 seconds, maintaining 99.999% availability. The system provides point-in-time recovery across all global replicas, handles network partitions gracefully, and can rebuild entire regions from replicated data. This global recovery architecture protects against data center failures, network partitions, and regional disasters while maintaining strong consistency across all replicas.

    <h3>Recovery Best Practices</h3>
    <p>Implementing effective recovery requires following proven practices and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

    <h4>Recovery Implementation Guidelines</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plan for Failure:</strong> Assume failures will occur and prepare accordingly</li>
      <li><strong>Test Regularly:</strong> Validate recovery procedures through regular testing</li>
      <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Maintain detailed recovery procedures and contacts</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor Continuously:</strong> Track system health and recovery metrics</li>
      <li><strong>Automate Where Possible:</strong> Reduce human error through automation</li>
      <li><strong>Train Staff:</strong> Ensure team members understand recovery procedures</li>
      <li><strong>Review and Update:</strong> Regularly update procedures based on lessons learned</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Recovery Pitfalls</h4>
    <div class="code-block">
      <pre><code>Recovery Anti-Patterns:

1. Untested Backups:
   Problem: Backups that can't be restored
   Solution: Regular restoration testing

2. Single Point of Failure:
   Problem: No redundancy in critical components
   Solution: Implement redundancy at all levels

3. Inadequate Documentation:
   Problem: Recovery procedures unclear or outdated
   Solution: Maintain current, detailed procedures

4. Insufficient Testing:
   Problem: Recovery procedures fail during real incidents
   Solution: Regular disaster recovery drills

5. Poor Communication:
   Problem: Stakeholders not informed during incidents
   Solution: Clear communication protocols

6. Ignoring Dependencies:
   Problem: External system dependencies not considered
   Solution: Map all system dependencies

7. Inadequate Monitoring:
   Problem: Failures not detected quickly
   Solution: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting</code></pre>
