    <h2>CAP Theorem</h2>
    <p>CAP theorem highlights the trade-offs in distributed systems.</p>

    <h3>Consistency</h3>
    <p>Consistency means all clients see the same data at the same time no matter which node they connect to.</p>

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>Availability means any client which requests data gets a response even if some of the nodes are down.</p>

    <h3>Partition Tolerance</h3>
    <p>A partition indicates a communication break between two nodes. Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions.</p>

    <div class="info-note">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong> According to CAP theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two of the three properties at any given time.
