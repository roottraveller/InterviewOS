## Definition
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, providing on-demand access to resources without direct management.

## Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual machines, storage, networking
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms, databases
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Complete applications
- **FaaS (Function as a Service)**: Serverless computing

## Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure, third-party providers
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private
- **Multi-Cloud**: Multiple cloud providers
- **Community Cloud**: Shared by specific community

## Key Characteristics
- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Provision resources automatically
- **Broad Network Access**: Available over network
- **Resource Pooling**: Shared resources across users
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Scale up/down quickly
- **Measured Service**: Pay-per-use pricing

## Major Cloud Providers
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Market leader, comprehensive services
- **Microsoft Azure**: Enterprise-focused, hybrid capabilities
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Data analytics, AI/ML strengths
- **IBM Cloud**: Enterprise, hybrid cloud solutions
- **Oracle Cloud**: Database and enterprise applications

## Benefits
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce capital expenditure
- **Scalability**: Scale resources based on demand
- **Flexibility**: Access from anywhere
- **Reliability**: High availability and redundancy
- **Innovation**: Access to latest technologies

## Challenges
- **Security Concerns**: Data privacy and compliance
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on specific providers
- **Network Dependency**: Requires internet connectivity
- **Cost Management**: Unexpected usage costs
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements

## Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Microservices**: Decomposed applications
- **Containers**: Portable application packaging
- **DevOps**: Continuous integration/deployment
- **API-First**: Service-oriented design
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace vs modify

## Migration Strategies
- **Lift and Shift**: Move existing applications as-is
- **Refactor**: Modify applications for cloud
- **Rebuild**: Redesign applications for cloud-native
- **Replace**: Adopt SaaS solutions

## Interview Questions
**Q: What's the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?**
A: IaaS provides infrastructure (VMs, storage), PaaS provides development platforms, and SaaS provides complete applications ready to use.
