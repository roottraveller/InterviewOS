## Definition
CI/CD is a software development practice that automates the integration, testing, and deployment of code changes.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Frequent Commits**: Regular code integration
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every commit
- **Build Automation**: Automatic build processes
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick notification of issues
- **Version Control**: Centralized code repository

## Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy to production automatically
- **Environment Promotion**: Move through dev/test/prod
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick reversion if issues arise
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated environment setup

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Source**: Code commit triggers pipeline
2. **Build**: Compile and package application
3. **Test**: Run automated tests
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to target environment
5. **Monitor**: Track application performance

## Benefits
- **Faster Releases**: Automated processes
- **Better Quality**: Automated testing catches issues
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, incremental changes
- **Faster Feedback**: Quick issue detection
- **Improved Collaboration**: Shared responsibility

## Popular Tools
- **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server
- **GitLab CI**: Integrated with GitLab
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's CI/CD platform
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's DevOps platform
- **CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI/CD

## Best Practices
- Keep builds fast
- Test early and often
- Maintain clean environments
- Use feature flags
- Monitor deployments

## Interview Questions
**Q: What's the difference between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery?**
A: Continuous Delivery prepares code for release, while Continuous Deployment automatically releases to production.`
